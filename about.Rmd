### Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

- Usable oxygen for fish or other marine created with gills. 
- Its provided by sea grass, wave action and photosynthetic organism.

### Tubidity

- Turbidity is how we measure water clarity. 
- High turbidity means there are lots of solid particles in the water. This can block sunlight, decrease growth, and minimize oxygen production. 

### Salinity

- Salinity is the amount of salt in the water. Ocean water has high salinity. 
- It helps determine what kinds of creatures can live in an environment and how they survive.
